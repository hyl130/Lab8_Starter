2. No

3. No, The "message" feature allows user to write and send a message to another user. Unit test can not test how individual components interact with each other, so it would not be appropriate to test the "message" feature using the unit test.

4. Yes, "max message length" feature is a small simple feature. We would use unit test to make sure each part of the code is functioning as it should.
